# Choropleth Map

## Overview

A choropleth map built with the D3.js library.

## Description

This project was a particularly challenging implementation of the D3.js library for me. The most difficult part of the project was using a given dataset with coordinates to draw all of the counties in the USA. A method from topojson was very helpful, since it gave me the chance to convert the dataset into a GeoJSON format (which D3 can then use to draw on the SVG canvas). 

Another aspect of this project that was difficult for me was understanding how to work with two datasets that are linked. Typically in previous projects, all of the data I have needed to use has been fetched in one call to an API. I appreciated the opportunity to use the .find() method for arrays, since that proved to be an efficient way to work with the given datasets.

This project was a fantastic opportunity for me to see the capabilities of the D3.js library. It is unlike any other project I have previously created in that it maps out data for an entire country. I can definitely see this being a useful skill in other data visualization projects.
